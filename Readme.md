## Project by Eric Li, finished 3/8/2021. ##
## DEPRECIATED DUE TO GARENA REMOVING THEIR MATCH HISTORY FUNCTION##

## Purpose and functionality ##
Tired of manually copy pasting names from the client chatbox into the league webpage to check individual match histories. 
Programme will scrape all usernames, and automactically open chrome windows with respective match histories 
built in python, using selenium for form input

## How to run ##
From the Terminal, run VENV\Scripts\activate 
run main.py (can be done with alt + shift + n in VSC) 
copy paste chatbox information into terminal 
main.py will sort out the names, and open 5 chrome windows, checking each of the player's match histories
